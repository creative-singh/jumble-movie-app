# Jumble Movie App Backend
Please give me a Movie in Jumble Words. I'll return you the list of movies with the same words.

## Plan
I will be making the Backend with Nest.js

I will use Next.js for Frontend.

For the Database, I'll use MongoDB.

## Requirements and Thinking
Only for Bollywood movies.
Earlier we can add a switch to search for :
- Hollywood
- Bollywood
- Both

Like `satya` is the movie name, So the user can search for `aatys`, and by clicking on enter I'll be calling an API and returning the list of movies that will have the same characters with the same character length.

## Action Items
- Store all the movies in MongoDB 

## API's
- POST - Add movie with validation to restrict duplicate movie insertion.
- POST - Add Bulk Movies with validations
- GET - Search API on a movie with keyword

## Frontend
- Make a search bar that will call API 
- List movie name
